# Overview

Balancer is infinitely extendible to allow for any conceivable pool type with custom curves, logic, parameters, and more.

## Use Cases

### Aave Safety Module

Aave is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Aave uses pool tokens from the **80/20 AAVE/WETH Weighted Pool** to lock funds in their [Safety Module](https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/safety-module) (SM) while still providing liquidity for the AAVE token.

> **The Safety Module solves the issues with traditional staking systems and market liquidity**: Tokens with locking/reward schemes tend to suffer from low market liquidity and extreme volatility when high percentages of the total supply are being locked. With the ability of contributing to the SM not only by locking AAVE, but also by contributing with liquidity \[on Balancer], stakers create a trustless and decentralized market with deep liquidity for trading AAVE against ETH.
